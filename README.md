# 🚗 **Car Resale Price Prediction**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
The **Car Resale Price Prediction** project aims to develop a **machine learning model** that accurately estimates the **resale price of used cars** based on multiple influencing factors. The used car market is highly dynamic, and various factors like **car brand, model, age, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and previous ownership history** impact the resale value.  

By leveraging **data science techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms**, this project provides **data-driven pricing recommendations** that benefit both car buyers and sellers. The model helps **individuals, dealerships, and resale platforms** make informed decisions about used car pricing.

## 🔍 **Key Features & Insights**  

### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** 🧹  
- Handled missing values and replaced outliers to maintain dataset integrity.  
- Encoded categorical variables such as **car brand, fuel type, and transmission type** into numerical form for model compatibility.  
- Standardized or normalized numerical features like **mileage and engine capacity** to improve model performance.  

### 2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified which features have the most impact on car resale price.  
- **Data Visualization**: Used **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to visualize trends in pricing based on **age, mileage, and car type**.  
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examined price distribution and detected any skewness in data.  

### 3️⃣ **Feature Engineering** ⚙  
- Selected the most relevant features affecting resale prices.  
- Created new derived features, such as **price depreciation rate per year** and **average mileage per year**.  
- Transformed categorical data into meaningful numerical representations using techniques like **one-hot encoding and label encoding**.  

### 4️⃣ **Model Training & Evaluation** 🤖  
- Applied multiple **machine learning models**, including:  
  ✅ **Linear Regression** – For understanding direct relationships between price and features.  
  ✅ **Decision Tree Regressor** – To capture non-linear interactions between variables.  
  ✅ **Random Forest Regressor** – To improve accuracy and handle overfitting.  
  ✅ **XGBoost** – An advanced gradient boosting model for enhanced prediction performance.  
- Evaluated model performance using key metrics:  
  - **R² Score** – Measures how well the model explains the variation in car prices.  
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** – Assesses prediction errors.  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Evaluates the average error between predicted and actual prices.  

### 5️⃣ **Prediction & Interpretation** 🔮  
- The model predicts **resale prices** based on user-input parameters (e.g., car age, mileage, fuel type, etc.).  
- Compared predictions from different models to determine the most accurate pricing strategy.  
- Analyzed **which factors influence price changes the most** to provide insights for sellers.
